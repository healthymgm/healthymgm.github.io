    <h1>HOW TO</h1>
    <p>For a person to be healthy they need to eat right. This means a lot of green veggies and lean meat and try to avoid calorie packed food and junk food as much as possible. Exercise is also a very vital role in a healthy life style. Now we know that many people are busy with their lives and have little time to go to the gym. So that is why we came up with a way to get some exercise when watching TV. You do a different sort of exercise each time a certain commercial comes on. For example if it is a car commercial you do jumping jacks, a commercial for a clothing store push ups so on and so forth.</p>
